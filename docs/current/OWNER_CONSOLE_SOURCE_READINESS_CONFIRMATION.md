# Owner Console Source Readiness Confirmation

## Scope

This confirmation answers the backend-source questions from:

```text
/Users/jiangwei/Documents/final-owner-console/docs/current/OWNER_CONSOLE_BACKEND_SOURCE_HANDOFF.md
```

It does not redefine Owner product-client layout, primary Owner vocabulary, or
StrategyGroup product design.

## Executive Result

| Source | Status | Evidence | Owner Console impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| StrategyGroup catalog | `ready` | Five tracked handoff files exist under `docs/current/strategy-group-handoffs/{MPG-001,TEQ-001,FBS-001,PMR-001,SOR-001}/handoff.json`; `main-control-handoff-index.md` lists all five groups. | Always show MPG / TEQ / FBS / PMR / SOR as catalog rows. Runtime-source problems must not make StrategyGroups disappear. |
| Strategy runtime repository | `ready` for Tokyo reports; `degraded` for local shell | Tokyo `strategygroup-runtime-pilot-status.json` reports active runtime rows and `status=waiting_for_market`; current local shell does not have PG env loaded. | Use Tokyo/read-only service as source for live runtime overlay. If local Owner Console backend lacks PG env, show catalog rows with `暂不可用`, not an empty catalog. |
| Runtime admission/binding | `ready` | `strategygroup-runtime-pilot-status.json` reports `runtime_binding=configured`; current control board counts: `total=5`, `observing=4`, `observe_only_ready=1`, `selected=1`. | StrategyGroup rows may show running/waiting states when readmodel is reachable. Admission unavailability should degrade row status only. |
| Watcher status | `ready` | `brc-runtime-signal-watcher.timer` is `active/enabled`; latest service run exited `SUCCESS`; latest `post-signal-resume-pack.json` reports `status=waiting_for_market`. | System freshness can be shown as running/waiting. Current user-facing state is `等待机会` / `无需操作`. |
| Live facts readiness | `ready` | `strategy-group-live-facts-readiness.json` reports `strategy_group_live_facts_ready_for_armed_observation`, `blockers=[]`, `observe_ready=5`, `armed_candidate_prepare_ready=4`. | Funds/orders/positions/protection health can be displayed as current. Fresh signal is still required before candidate/action path. |
| Account funds | `ready` | `strategy-group-live-facts-input.json` reports `account.status=fresh`, `available_balance_present=true`, `available_balance_positive=true`, and budget coverage for the Owner-allocated subaccount/profile boundary. | Show sanitized fund pool status. Do not show API keys, account ids, raw secrets, or full wallet detail. |
| Local orders | `ready_empty` | `strategy-group-live-facts-input.json` reports `open_orders.open_order_count=0`, `status=no_open_orders`; no exchange write was called. | Show `暂无订单`, not `订单状态暂不可用`. |
| Local positions | `ready_empty` | `strategy-group-live-facts-input.json` reports `active_position.active_count=0`, `status=no_active_position`. | Show `暂无持仓`, not `持仓状态暂不可用`. |
| Protection state | `ready` | `strategy-group-live-facts-input.json` reports `protection.status=ready_for_candidate_specific_plan`; handoff risk defaults define stop-loss and exit plan. | Show `保护正常` for observation state; candidate-specific protection is created only when a fresh candidate exists. |
| Reconciliation state | `degraded` | Current readiness reports prove no active position, no open order, no order creation, and no exchange write in the latest watcher cycle; no separate latest reconciliation summary was included in the source-readiness evidence set. | Homepage can show `系统正常` only for no-active-order/no-position observation. Detailed reconciliation panel should show `对账详情暂不可用` until a dedicated latest reconciliation source is wired. |
| Operation audit | `degraded` | Main runtime contains Operation Layer API/repository code (`/api/brc/operations`, `PgBrcOperationRepository`) and Trading Console operations cockpit endpoint, but the current watcher source-readiness evidence set does not include an authenticated operation-audit list probe. | Do not block StrategyGroup visibility. Hide or degrade audit/detail history with `审计详情暂不可用` until Owner Console has a read-only operation-audit source. |

## Owner Console Source Contract

### Required Fallback Rule

StrategyGroup catalog readiness and runtime readiness are separate.

| Condition | Required Owner Console behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Catalog `ready` and runtime source `ready` | Show StrategyGroups with live runtime overlay. |
| Catalog `ready` and runtime source `degraded` | Show StrategyGroups with `暂不可用` and one plain reason. |
| Catalog `ready` and runtime source `unavailable` | Show StrategyGroups with `暂不可用`; do not return `strategies=[]`. |
| Catalog unavailable | Show system-level `暂不可用`; this is a source failure, not an empty strategy list. |

### Empty Versus Unavailable

| Source | Empty state | Unavailable state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orders | `ready_empty` -> `暂无订单` | `unavailable` -> `订单状态暂不可用` |
| Positions | `ready_empty` -> `暂无持仓` | `unavailable` -> `持仓状态暂不可用` |
| Account funds | `ready` -> sanitized funds status | `unavailable` -> `资金状态暂不可用` |
| Operation audit | Empty audit list may be valid if source is readable | `degraded/unavailable` must not hide StrategyGroups |

## Required Owner Console Changes

These changes belong in:

```text
/Users/jiangwei/Documents/final-owner-console
```

1. Keep the StrategyGroup catalog visible from the handoff catalog even when
   runtime/PG source is unavailable.
2. Add `sourceHealth` semantics that distinguish `ready_empty` from
   `unavailable`.
3. Map `waiting_for_market` / `waiting_for_signal` to Owner language such as
   `等待机会` and `无需操作`.
4. Show account funds only as sanitized readonly status and bounded numeric
   summaries.
5. Treat Operation audit as a detail-source dependency, not a prerequisite for
   StrategyGroup visibility.

## Main Runtime Changes Needed

These changes belong in:

```text
/Users/jiangwei/Documents/final
```

1. Produce a stable machine-readable source-readiness artifact for Owner Console,
   derived from the same sources as this confirmation.
2. Add a read-only Operation audit list/detail probe to the source-readiness
   artifact.
3. Add a dedicated latest reconciliation summary source, separate from
   watcher/no-position/no-order inference.
4. Keep Tokyo signed GET-only live fact collection as the current account,
   order, position, protection, and budget source for the pilot.

## Not Authorized

- No real order placement.
- No exchange write action.
- No FinalGate bypass.
- No Operation Layer bypass.
- No credential or secret mutation.
- No live profile expansion.
- No order-sizing default expansion.
- No withdrawal or transfer action.

## Current Owner-Facing Summary
