# Live-safe v1 Progress

Use this file for session progress and handoff notes.

## 2026-04-29

- Archived pre-live-safe docs, tests, scripts, and generated artifacts.
- Established new program-scoped planning model under `docs/ops/`.
- Adopted Codex-led, Claude-bounded execution workflow.

## 2026-04-30

- Landed `Decision Trace Backbone v0` as a minimal, non-blocking trace backbone for risk decision JSONL output.
- Added `ADR-0002` to document Decision Trace Backbone v0 semantics, scope, and non-goals.
- Landed `LS-001` so the main runtime starts isolated order-watch tasks and exchange order updates can enter the local lifecycle path in real time.
- Landed `LS-002` so runtime daily risk limits now update from projected exit deltas and full position lifecycle closes.
- Kept scope tight: no `api.py` order-watch coverage, no trace expansion, no strategy/risk/profile changes.
- Deferred known follow-ups instead of expanding scope: duplicate `watch_orders` definition cleanup and re-evaluation of one-task-per-symbol if runtime symbol count grows.

## Next

- Keep the live-safe backbone thin; do not widen trace or order-watch into larger subsystems yet.
- Use the post-merge hardening ADR and task board entries as the backlog for the next iteration:
  - trace boundary cleanup
  - multi-symbol order-watch hardening
  - daily stats persistence before live expansion

## 2026-05-06

- Started LS-002b / LS-107 implementation after Owner approved the task card.
- Implemented direction: PG aggregate + event ledger, fixed `scope_key="runtime:default"`, no-new-entry fail-closed on daily stats persistence restore/write-through failure.
- Preserved LS-002 daily stats semantics and documented the accepted non-transactional crash/write window in ADR-0004.
- Targeted tests pass for LS-002b, LS-002 daily limits, and TM-002 exit projection observability.
- Alembic revision graph has single head `007`; local `alembic upgrade head` is blocked by existing SQLite schema/version drift at old revision `002`, before the LS-002b migration runs.
